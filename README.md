# keylux

Open-source per-key RGB control for mechanical keyboards, written in Rust.
Native **AULA F75** support plus an **OpenRGB SDK backend** for Corsair, Razer,
ASUS, Logitech, HyperX, SteelSeries, and other compatible keyboards.

Per-key colour, animations, and scriptable effects. The F75 connects directly
over USB or its receiver. Other brands use a separately running OpenRGB SDK
server. No firmware modification is required for the listed targets.

> **Status:** the native F75 protocol is verified on hardware. The new OpenRGB
> backend has automated protocol and CLI integration tests; the additional
> models still need physical validation with keylux. See the
> [keyboard compatibility guide](docs/KEYBOARDS.md) for 15 mechanical targets,
> two additional optical/Hall-effect targets, setup, and connection limits.

## Why

The F75 is a popular budget board with no open-source lighting support. OpenRGB
has an [open, unimplemented request](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/issues/4232)
for it, and the one published reverse-engineering write-up stops at the point
where colours refuse to render.

This project documents the full protocol — including the parts that are
genuinely surprising — and turns it into something usable.

## What works

- Per-key static colour (permanent storage through the native F75 driver)
- Native F75 animation at ~21 FPS; OpenRGB streaming capped at 20 FPS,
  adjustable downward
- Native F75 LED map and dynamic LED order/matrix geometry from OpenRGB
- Device picker, saved device selection, reconnects, and CLI discovery
- Desktop app with a live keyboard preview and controls generated from each
  effect's own parameter declaration
- Built-in effects: solid, wave, sweep, bloom, scrolling text
- User effects as `.rhai` scripts, hot-reloaded from `effects/`
- Keyframe animations: paint them in the timeline editor, or import a GIF,
  image or folder of frames
- Runs in the system tray (Windows), so the lighting keeps going with the
  window closed
- Application lighting profiles (Windows and Linux/X11): automatically switch effects and
  their settings when you focus a game, code editor, or another application

See [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md) for the native F75 protocol and
[`docs/KEYBOARDS.md`](docs/KEYBOARDS.md) for cross-brand control.

## Build

Needs a Rust toolchain and a C linker (`hidapi` links against system HID
libraries).

- **Windows** — [rustup](https://rustup.rs) plus Visual Studio Build Tools with
  the C++ workload
- **Linux** — rustup, plus the distro-specific packages listed below
- **macOS** — rustup and Xcode command line tools

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Linux permissions and dependencies

Building `keylux` needs the GTK 3 development headers and a few system
libraries for HID and input emulation. Install these packages for your
distribution before running `cargo build --release`.

**Debian/Ubuntu**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libxdo-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev pkg-config
```

**RHEL/Fedora**

```bash
sudo dnf install gtk3-devel libxdo-devel libudev-devel libusb1-devel pkg-config
```

**Arch/Manjaro**

```bash
sudo pacman -S gtk3 xdotool libusb pkgconf
```

Opening the vendor HID interface needs a udev rule:

```bash
sudo cp packaging/99-aula.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

The rule covers the wired board. A 2.4 GHz receiver has its own id, so
`packaging/99-aula.rules` carries a commented template to fill in with whatever
`scan --deep` reports.

## Cross-brand quick start

1. Install a current [OpenRGB release](https://openrgb.org/releases.html)
   that detects your keyboard. The compatibility reference is 1.0rc3.
2. Connect the keyboard by USB and start OpenRGB's **SDK Server** on
   `127.0.0.1:6742`. Close other applications that are actively controlling its
   lighting, including OpenRGB effects plugins.
3. Run `cargo run -p aula-app`. In **Settings → Keyboard**, rescan and select
   your OpenRGB keyboard. Pick an effect or use the editor's live preview.

```powershell
cargo run -p aula-app -- keyboards
cargo run -p aula-app -- devices --openrgb 127.0.0.1:6742
# Replace the name below with the exact connected name printed by devices.
cargo run -p aula-app -- wave 20 --openrgb 127.0.0.1:6742 --keyboard "Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro"
```

`--openrgb IP:PORT` restricts CLI discovery to that server. `--native` restricts
it to AULA HID. With neither flag, both enabled backends are available and the
GUI's saved selection is respected. Use `--help` for all connection options.

The GUI controls one selected keyboard at a time. OpenRGB support follows the
exact model, firmware, and connection detected by OpenRGB; see the
[full model table](docs/KEYBOARDS.md#model-targets).

## Native AULA F75 quick start

Both **wired USB-C** and the **2.4 GHz receiver** work. Every command below picks
whichever is attached; the wired board wins when both are.

The two are different USB devices speaking different protocols, so they behave
differently and the difference is not hideable:

| | Wired | Receiver |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rate | 21 FPS | **~8 FPS** full-board; faster for sparse effects |
| Update | whole 378-byte framebuffer, one write | whole frame, ~10 writes of 20 bytes |
| Cost driven by | nothing much | number of **distinct colours** |

Colours on the receiver are **quantised** to a small palette, because a frame
costs 4 bytes per distinct colour and has to fit one message. Wired sends each
key a continuous colour, so a gradient flows through a key where the receiver
steps through it.

The receiver is also **throughput-limited**, to about 64 chunks per second —
measured, and the vendor's own driver uses about a fifth of that. A whole-board
frame is 8 chunks, so it lands at ~8 FPS; a sparse effect costs less and runs
faster. Pushing past it does not fail cleanly: the board flickers between the
new frame and the old, which looks like something fighting the effect for
control of the colours.

So full-board animation is a wired feature in practice, and the receiver is at
its best with static colour and sparse effects — which is what the vendor's own
software does with it. Its smooth wireless effects are **firmware** effects,
rendered on the keyboard with the radio idle. `docs/PROTOCOL.md` has the
arithmetic. Bluetooth exposes nothing on either.

```bash
cargo run --example smoke -- scan             # devices that speak the protocol
cargo run --example smoke -- scan --deep      # also look for a receiver
cargo run --example smoke -- ping             # read the config block, write nothing
cargo run --example smoke -- red              # whole board red
cargo run --example smoke -- wave 20          # streamed rainbow wave for 20 seconds
cargo run --example smoke -- dry              # print packet headers, no hardware needed
```

## Running in the tray

Closing the window asks whether to minimise to the tray or quit, and can
remember the answer. Minimising hides to the tray as well. Both, plus whether
the lighting keeps rendering while hidden, are under **Window** at the bottom of
the effects panel.

The tray icon's menu has *Show*, *Play / pause lighting* and *Quit*; a
double-click reopens the window.

**Hiding to the tray is Windows-only for now.** egui does not repaint a hidden
window, so reopening one has to go through the windowing system directly, and
only the Windows path is implemented. Elsewhere the app refuses to hide at all
and closing simply quits — better than a window nothing can bring back. The
same applies if the tray icon cannot be created.

Preferences live in `%APPDATA%\keylux\settings.json` (or
`~/.config/keylux/settings.json`), and can be edited or deleted by hand.

## Application lighting profiles

Open the **Apps** tab to give each application its own lighting:

1. Choose **Default lighting** for applications without a matching profile.
2. Click **Add application profile** and name it, for example *Coding* or *Gaming*.
3. On Windows, enter executable names such as `Code.exe, cursor.exe` or your game's
   `.exe`. **Choose application…** adds a full path to match only that installation.
   On Linux/X11, enter the application's `WM_CLASS`, such as `Code` or `Firefox`.
   Focus the application, return to keylux, and click **Add last active app** to
   use the detected class. You can also run `xprop WM_CLASS` and click a window;
   use the second quoted value. Matches are exact, ignoring case.
4. Choose an effect and adjust its colors, speed, brightness, and other controls.
   **Use current lighting for this profile** copies your selection from Play.
5. Enable **Switch automatically** and focus the application.

The first matching enabled profile wins; **Move up** and **Move down** change
priority. Profiles and the default are saved with your preferences and restored
on startup. Returning to an unmatched application restores the default. Disabling
automatic switching also restores the default, after which Play works manually.

Detection follows the foreground application, so a game running in the background
does not override your editor. It runs on the lighting worker, including while
keylux is in the tray with background lighting enabled. Opening keylux keeps the
current lighting selected so you can edit or copy it. Pause still stops lighting
writes, and the composition editor's live preview takes priority.

Missing effect files and animations blocked by the wireless link use the default
and show a warning. If the default is also unavailable, a solid color is used.
The saved profile stays intact and is used again when its effect or wired
connection becomes available. Automatic foreground detection supports Windows and
Linux X11 sessions. Wayland is not supported, including XWayland applications;
the toggle is disabled there. macOS can save profiles but cannot switch automatically.

The X11 detector is adapted from [headblade-dev's contribution in PR #15](https://github.com/SibteProf/keylux/pull/15).

## Writing an effect

Effects are pure functions of time: given `t` and the keyboard's physical
layout, produce a frame. They **declare** their own parameters, and the UI
builds controls from that declaration — so a new script gets sliders and colour
pickers for free.

Drop a `.rhai` file into `effects/` and it appears in the list within a second,
sliders and all; edit it while the app runs and the change is picked up without
a restart. The shipped examples in that folder are the quickest way in, and the
Rust trait behind it is in
[`crates/aula-effects/src/lib.rs`](crates/aula-effects/src/lib.rs).

## Contributing

Adding another keyboard is very welcome — the process is documented at the end
of [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

Please read the safety rules in the protocol doc first. Some are not obvious
and one of them can brick a keyboard.

### A note on OpenRGB

OpenRGB is GPLv2, and permissive licensing here does not get in its way. The
protocol itself is a set of facts about how the hardware behaves, documented
in [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) — anyone is free to implement it, and
an OpenRGB driver would be written in C++ from those notes rather than by
copying this Rust code. Contributions upstreaming F75 support to OpenRGB are
very welcome.
